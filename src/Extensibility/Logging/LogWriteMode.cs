    /// a wait-for-commit mode under certain abnormal conditions or during normal application exit.  The
    /// LogWriteMode.WaitForCommit setting allows the issuer of a log message to specifically request that the

    /// on disk.  Messages written with this mode could be lost if the application crashes and Loupe
    /// is not able to flush its queue to the log file on disk.  Under certain unusual conditions and
    /// during normal application exit, even calls with this explicit setting may be forced to behave as
    /// WaitForCommit to provide better logging integrity in those scenarios.

    /// This setting indicates that the caller needs to make sure this message makes it into the

    /// force a flush of the queue and block until Loupe has committed the message to the log file on
    /// disk.  Messages written with this mode will not be lost--IF the call completes and returns--but
    /// will incur a significant performance hit, so it should generally only be used for critical information
    /// which needs to survive a crash scenario to help diagnose the cause of the crash.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>WaitForCommit mode still can not guarantee that the log message will make it to disk in pathological cases,
    /// but it designates this as a higher priority than performance for an individual log message for scenarios
    /// where the persistence of this information is expected to be important in diagnosing a condition which
    /// might prevent normal Queued messages from making it to disk--for example, when the caller will be causing
    /// the application to exit abruptly upon return and needs the log to reflect the reason why.</para></remarks>
